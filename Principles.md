#  <font color="#4E937A">OPEN SOURCE V2: Principles</font>

## :: Preface :: 
We look to analyze and depict Open source as a philosophy, understanding the term has taken on a bigger form than “Software”, but also an initiative of Community-orientated development, transparency and collaborative participation. 

We honor the roots of the Open Source Principles by building upon their framework of Principles, but with a deeper lens and acknowledgement of people who are marginalized by Open-Source communities and centers them within the principles and conversations. 

These are living Principles - with the purpose to be regularly re-evaluated and modified to change and grow reflecting upon social and technological systems and the issues marginalized communities face with the Open Source community; 

*Last Update Winter 2024.*

### → Why is there a need for new principles?: 

While noble, the original principle of “No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups” often fails to protect those contributing within open-source communities, highlighting a gap between idealistic language and practical inclusivity. The philosophy of being “free and open” has fallen short, as the open source remains biased and exclusionary, frequently replicating systemic inequities and creating an overrepresented majority. One critic states, 
> “Open source is almost as biased and discriminatory as other forms of technology and knowledge production as it creates an overrepresented majority within the field.” 

These findings demand the reevaluation of the foundational principles, to instead reshape them with a focus on marginalized communities and equity. Despite their flaws, principles remain essential for fostering accountability and encouraging long-term thinking, serving as a framework to guide open-source development toward fairness, sustainability, and true openness.

## → Principles

#### 1. Open source extends beyond software; it applies to all mediums and approaches.  

#### 2. By leveraging open source, communities are empowered to break away from exploitative structures, create from locally sourced knowledge, and distribute resources without incurring royalty or fee-based costs.

#### 3. Change is emergent! - Open Source needs to allow modifications and derived works, providing the opportunity for external audiences to add their own perspectives and knowledge to works. This allows work to sustain relevance, in respect to the ever-adapting technological world. It is important to note that the Integrity of The Author’s Source Code is vital, always providing a reference to the original work.   

#### 4. The license must be technology-neutral, meaning that no aspect of the license should be dependent on any specific technology or interface style. This ensures the license remains universally applicable and adaptable over time.  

#### 5. Open as in, leveraging open source values as a gateway to inclusion, practicing equity in attribution, ensuring no discrimination, and embracing an intersectional approach that values and acknowledges diverse identities and experiences.  

#### 6. The voices of those directly impacted by systemic barriers must be a core consideration, with empathy guiding decisions to center and amplify their perspectives in conversation and collaboration.  

#### 7. Communities should include varied perspectives while fostering critical discussions and evaluations to identify and mitigate potentially harmful ideas. 

#### 8. Open Source should have respectful and welcoming communities, free from offensive language or behavior that is unprofessional or unwelcome. Instead of immediate bans, prioritize understanding the context, engaging in constructive dialogue, and educating individuals on the impact of their actions to encourage positive change.  

#### 9. Bias in all its forms, whether related to access, algorithms, cultural assumptions, stereotypes, or gender disparities must be identified and addressed. Mitigating bias requires mindfulness of cognitive tendencies, the use of rigorous methodologies, systematic information gathering, triangulation of data from diverse sources, and an active effort to consider dissenting perspectives.  

#### 10. Protect User Data- projects must prioritize safeguarding user privacy by minimizing data collection, ensuring secure data handling, and maintaining disclosure about data usage.
